    # this is only temporary until we have some 'external' control programs.
    # 'drukards walk'
    # This is equivalent to what the players program will request
    # Which means only the thrust and rotation can be set here
    #
    # In practice, on each tick, we give the current actual position of all
    # ships and the thrust and rotation (as we currently know it)
    #
    # During the next tick, each ship's new thrust and rotation will be received
    # from each player and this will be used to compute the actual position for
    # the next tick.
    #
    # The competing programs will only know the predicted thrust and rotation for
    # the opposing fleet, not what will happen during the tick (e.g. full forward to
    # full reverse) so the predictions will often be 'wrong'.
    #
    # For this reason we can't use the predicted value to display the game in the
    # browser, we have to use the actual values. This means the browser display
    # has to lag by 1 tick behind the actual game play.
    #
    # We will have to look at what this means when players are playing 'manually'.
    # 
    #
    # So, as mentioned above. This code currently assumes that the thrust and rotation
    # were received during the previous tick period, only to be acted upon now 'as if'
    # the command were received at the start of the previous tick period.
